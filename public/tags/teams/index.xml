    <description><![CDATA[Overview A few things have changed since I wrote on Teams rules to monitor for offline devices. Reference Article In response to the growing importance of real-time call quality monitoring, a set of new rules have been added:
Audio quality for in-progress meetings Video quality for in-progress meetings Screen sharing quality for in-progress meetings This service is limited to accounts assigned with a premium license or MTR Pro License, a restriction that presents a challenge for many organizations.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Introduction When this new feature was released, it was time to dust my old Polycom VVX 500 phone and provision it for Teams basic call functionality.
The official Microsoft documentation for all the pre-requisites and supported devices can be found here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/sip-gateway-plan https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/sip-gateway-configure Procedure Enable your custom or global policy to enable SIP devices can be used for calls I went deep dive immediately and ignored a very important step which caused me some wasted time and some troubleshooting efforts.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Introduction Managing phones through Teams Admin Center has been challenging at times especially when staying up to date with firmware and application updates. Part of the challenge is that the phones at time do not register correctly, do not reflect immediate changes, do not appear in the dashboard at times, and fail to update when pushing the update. These challenges can be prevented or minimized by having correct compliance policies, accurate configuration and solid network connectivity.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Request To block an inbound (External PSTN) number.
Pre-requisites If applicable
Administrator access to the SBC Tenant Teams Administrator Procedure Audiocodes SBC IP to IP Routing The two key settings to determine is the Source Username Pattern ( number to be blocked ) and the destination type and set the destination addressit to 0.0.0.0
Classification This option we have an actual action type to deny this number. Probably the one that will terminate the call faster without going first through all the routing and manipulation rules.]]></description>

    <title>Teams Device Monitoring and Alerting Offline Status</title>

    <description><![CDATA[Initial Thoughts This new feature capability offered in the Teams Admin Center is a nice complementary option to monitor devices and alert Admins when they go offline.
A great use scenario is for Conference Room devices or Executive level phones and while it&rsquo;s not preventative, it does help Admins to react fast when devices go offline whether at a individual or site level.

    <description><![CDATA[Introduction Webinar is a new feature in Teams designed for up to 1,000 attendees with the ability to use a registration form, all the built in meeting features and a hidden feature of a Microsoft list where automation could be leverage for added control.

    <description><![CDATA[Issue Recently encountered an issue where IP Phones (Polycom CCX) were unable to register to Azure AD and would not appear in the Microsoft Teams Admin Center list of IP Phone devices. Most times this should not be an issue except if the company has Intune enabled and endpoint manager resctricting devices from registering due to compliance policies.
Solution I knew there were some recommendations to exclude these phones from any device compliance as it could create more harm than good and not gaining a full set of features for these devices since all software and firmware can be pushed through the teams admin center.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Introduction After my final thoughts on my article PSTN call records with Microsoft Graph I wanted to move this data to Microsoft Lists with Power Automate
The benefits are quite a few as expressed before :
More granular control over how the process is automated via Microsoft Graph Access leveraging all the possible queries and correlating information that Graph offers.
This process allows to run as a scheduled task or even as an Azure function.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This post is an exercise and all credit goes to this blog - script on Github by leeford-Get-TeamsPSTNCallRecords Getting the Reports There are a couple of ways to retrieve basic information for PSTN calls whether is Microsoft&rsquo;s dial plans or direct routing. The easiest way would be from the Teams&rsquo; Admin Center -&gt; Analytics &amp; Reports -&gt; Usage Report.
We can see some basic PSTN call information like time, caller, type of call, destination, duration, etc but the interface is small and having to navigate up and down and left - right can be less desirable]]></description>
